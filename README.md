## Description
Quiz Game is a timed, multiple choice, mini-game application where the player answers a series of questions against a 60 second countdown timer. The player wins the game by answering all of the questions before running out of time. 

The game opens up at the Quiz Game landing page that provides the player with instructions for the game. The player starts the game by clicking the 'Start Button' and will then be presented with the first question. Only one question and its multiple choice answers are presented per page view. Once an answer is submitted the player will then be prompted with a notification of "Correct" for a right answer and "Incorrect" for a wrong answer. Correct answers will award the player with one point and automatically advance the player to the next question, any incorrect answers will deduct 10 seconds from the remaining game play.
